.SH SYNOPSIS
.B btmakemetafile
\fI<trackerurl> <file> \fR[\fIfile\fR...] [\fIparams\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbtmakemetafile\fP is a program that is used to generate the torrent info files
that are distributed to bittorrent clients (usually over http) to inform them
of where the designated tracker for the torrent is located, and to enable them
to verify the file's contents.
.PP
\fBbtmakemetafile\fP requires two arguments. The first is the file that you
wish to generate a torrent info file for. The second is the "announce" 
address of a tracker (ex. http://127.0.0.1:6969/announce).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-announce_list\fR <arg>
.IP
a list of announce tracker URLs for redundancy/backup (defaults to '')
.IP
the accepted format is:
.IP
url[,url...][|url[,url...]...]
.IP
where URLs separated by commas are all tried first
before the next group of URLs separated by the pipe is checked.
If none is given, it is assumed you don't want one in the metafile.
If announce_list is given, clients which support it
will ignore the <announce> value.
