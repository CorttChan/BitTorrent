in a shell, go to the root BitTorrent directory and run this command

python winsetup.py py2exe

change to the newly created subdirectory dist, copy bittorrent.nsi
and the gifs and icons into that directory, and run nsis on it.

cd dist
copy ..\bittorrent.nsi .
copy ..\*.gif .
copy ..\icon*.ico .
c:\progra~1\nsis\makensis.exe bittorrent.nsi

This will create an installer called bittornado-x.x.x.w32install.exe

The installer is completely self-contained and will work on any 
Windows machine, even without the above software having been 
installed.
